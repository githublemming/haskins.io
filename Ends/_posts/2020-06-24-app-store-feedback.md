My submission was reject. The reason they gave was that I need to provide a video of the application running.

>We have started the review of your app, but we are not able to continue because we need access to a video that

>Please only include footage in your demo video of your app running on a physical watchOS device, and not on a simulator.

I'm a bit confused by what they mean by a physical watchOS device, and not a simulator. Do I have to somehow record the
application running on my Apple Watch? That could be tricky to get it looking good.

Plus they've also said that it is acceptable to use a screen recorder, but I didn't think I could record the simulator?

This needs some research done to find out exactly what they mean.
