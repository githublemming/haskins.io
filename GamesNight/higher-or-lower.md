# Higher or Lower

**_Play your cards right_**

Higher or Lower is a simple game where the player has to guess whether the next card is going to be either Higher or Lower
than the current card.

## Game Play
A deck of 52 cards is shuffled and displayed on the screen layed out in one long line face down. The first card is placed
face up.

The player has the option to change the starting card. This can only be done once.

When they are happy with the starting card they have to decide if the next card is going to be higher or lower. If they
get it right they keep choosing until they get it wrong.
