# Ends

Ends is a standalone Apple Watch application that allow you to track the score and number of ends in your Lawn Bowls
application.

The application has three screens each with a specific task.

### Home Screen

The home page is the entry point into the application. It shows the current status of the game consisting of the score 
for the Home and Away teams, as well as the current end number. It is presented in a similar manner to the standard 
horizontal Lawn Bowls scoreboard.

This screen also presents a way of resetting the values to start a new game.

### Add End Screen

On this screen you can add a new end to the game.

To add a new end to the game tap either the large Home or Away button until you get the required score. If you overshoot
you can use the small minus buttons to correct the score. Once you are happy tap the **Add End** button.

The application currently only supports 1 side getting a score. If you try and set a score for both sides the side you
are not adjusting will be reset to back to zero.

It is possible to set a zero score for both sides for those rare occurances, simply click the **Add End** button.

### Game Overview Screen

The game overview page presents all the ends that have been played within the game.
 
It uses a layout similar to a Lawn Bowls scorecard. If the team scored points they are shown, if not a Zero is shown. The
points and end are laid out in a similar manner to the home screen.
 
To get to this page swipe left on Home Screen.

### Complications

The application provides complications. Depending on which complication to use, will determine the amount of data that
is shown.

The smaller complications will either just show the end number, while the larger complications will show the End, along
with the current scores.
