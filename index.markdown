# Hello and Welcome to haskins.io

## What is this site
Essentially it's a dumping ground for all my thoughts and ideas. It is powered by Jekyll using an AWS S3 bucket to host
the static site. Why? because I'm too cheap to fork out on dedicated hosting.

## Who am I?
I'm a software engineer that is currently working as an AWS / Azure Systems Engineer. As you may infer from the links
below, I also enjoy a bit of photograhy.

#### Some links that relate to me
