Good News! Received an email to state that Ends has been accepted for the app store and will be release shortly.

Looking at the documention it might take upto 24hrs before it can be found in the store, so I'll have to keep an eye
on that. Once it's available I'll have to add one of those 'Download from App Store' badges on the project page.
