It turns out, (accordingly to the internet), that all I needed to do was create a video of the application running of my
own watch. So I attached my iPhone to my tripod (yes I have an attachment for when I'm doing mobile phone photography),
pointed it at my watch sat on my desk, and then recorded the watch face as I used the application.

That's now been uploaded, and have resubmitted the application for review. Let's see what happens next :)
