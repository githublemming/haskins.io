So after what seems like a lifetime, though it's only been two years (on and off) I've finally got a hopefully stable 
and bug free release of the software to submit to the macOS app store this weekend. Hopefully if all goes well it will 
be available to the public about a week or so after that. My fingers are crossed which explains any typos' :)
