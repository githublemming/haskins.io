On Friday evening I submitted Games Night for review in the App Store. Within 6 hours it had been rejected, though this
was because I had been overly cautions with the age rating and ticked a couple of things that I thought I might need;
Gambling and Simulated Gambling. I'd ticked these as they might consider the games alluded to gambling, but it turns out
Individual developers are allowed to submit applications with those ticked.

So when I woke up on Saturday morning I removed those options and resubmitted. The state changed from 'awaiting review'
to 'in review' at around 2000hrs Saturday night. It's now Monday morning and it's still under review. I can only assume
that Games Night has passed all the automated checks, and it is now in the hands of a reviewer.

This is quite a nerve racking process!
