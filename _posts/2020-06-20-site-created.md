I've been working on a few Apple related applications recently, Ends and Games Night, and I realised that I was going
to need a website to host some data that is required for the App Store.

I bought this domain a couple of years ago now, and decided it was time to dust it off and use it.

As one of the applications is going to be free (Ends), while the other will have a yet-to-be-decide cost, I decided that
I didn't want to spend a lot of money on the hosting of the site as they might not be much Return On Investment. I could
have went with Wordpress.com I suppose but I wanted to keep it things simple for the moment.

So here it is; a static website powered by Jekyll, hosted in a AWS S3 bucket.
